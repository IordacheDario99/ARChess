# ARChess

ARChess is a chess game made with Unity 3D engine and Wikitude SDK for android devices that allows the user to explore the wonders of augmented reality world

This is a fully playable AR chess game that is meant to help its user play chess wherever he or she wants, without having to carry a chess board that is most often heavy and bulky. With the help of Wikitude SDK and Unity 3D I managed to develope a game that uses Augmented Reality technology.
The game has 3 game modes, allowing the user to chose what suits him / her the best.

### 1. Classic Chess ![photo_2022-03-09_20-39-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49655223/157516730-4bec951b-e506-436f-9300-2a15dffbb0b9.jpg)
This is a simple mode that projects the same chess board into a virtual scene. The user is able to preform any special move (like the pawn promotion, en pasant etc.). While doing so, the user can change the camera perspective by using the UI elements on the screen. By having a multidimensional list, all the moves are registerd and based on that registration the uer can move freely and attack the opponent chess pices according to the chess rules

### 2. ARChess (Instant Tracking) ![photo_2022-03-09_20-38-38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49655223/157517006-9efe27d5-2891-457d-a2e7-51aaacf97cf6.jpg)
The user is able to augment the reality by casting the chess board "into" the real world with the help of SLAM technology, technology that stays at the base of Instant Tracking feature. In order to start a chess match, the user must select the desired hight at which the table will be projected in the "real world". After selecting the desired hight, the user have to press the "start tracking" button so that the instant tracking will occur.

### 3. ARChess (Image Recognition)
